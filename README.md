Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?
Artemis Financial was the client, and the issue was security coverage for their financial software, for their clientele.

What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?
Upon analyzing the code, security vulnerabilites were found and were addressed through different means. It is important to code securely to prevent security breaches and loss of reputation, money, data, and clientele. Trust
is neccessary. The value is paramount, as malicious intent must be prevented for a thriving business.

Running tests is important and what was done to make sure it was functional and secure. Tests were ran again after refactoring and a dependency check report was used.

What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
Dependency checks will be useful along with code testing. Input validation and others being adhered to are what make for a secure application.

Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?
Future employees from this assignment can see a detailed code analysis along with a vulnerability report with the steps taken to fix the problems. They can also see the encrypted https along with thoroughness.
